# AWS DevOps - CI/CD Pipeline in AWS

## Code Pipeline

- Fully managed CI/CD by AWS.
- Automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the code everytime there is a change.
- No severs to manage
- Fully integrated AWS services
- Continuous Delivery.End to End software release.
- Integration with third party tools: Works with GitHub, Jenkins, SonarQube etc.

## Build Tools - AWS Code Build (alternative to maven)

- Service that compiles source code, run tests, and produces software packages that are already ready to be deployed.
- Eliminates the need to provision, manage and scale your own build servers.
- Costly tool.
- Fully managed.

## Code Pipeline An Example

It is the step by step process via which we can automate the project deployment.

**Github.com** -> **Code Build** -> **Beanstalk**

**Note** - Beanstalk is a service offered by AWS where the complete infra like ec2 instances, load balancer, autoscaling, security managed by AWS.

### Create the pipeline

- Go to AWS Console and search for CodePipline

- Click on 'Create Pipepline' and select 'Build custom pipline' then click 'Next'

- On this window, Give a Pipeline name, then select 'Superseded' as Execution mode.
- Then select 'New service role' as Service role, then please provide role service name, then click next.

- Open the following link in another tab or window of the browser.
    - https://github.com/akshu20791/apachewebsite

- Click on fork button

- Go back to your code pipeline creation window and select the 'GitHub(via OAuth app)' from source provider list.

- Click on connect
  - There connect your github account with the aws code pipeline

- Then select repo forked above from the repositries list and select master as the branch, then click next.

- Skip the build page and skip test page

- Then from the Deploy provide list select, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Lets deploy the sample php application on elastic beanstalk

![alt text](image-43.png)
![alt text](image-44.png)
![alt text](image-45.png)

- Then Press Next
- In front of Service role -> Create role
    - Next -> next -> create role
        ![alt text](image-46.png)
        ![alt text](image-47.png)
- Go back to elastic beanstalk -> check the role\
![alt text](image-48.png) 
- Similarly create role for ec2 instance
    - Create role -> next -> next -> next
        ![alt text](image-49.png)
![alt text](image-50.png)
- To generate the key pair -> go to ec2 -> create a new keypair
![alt text](image-51.png) 
![alt text](image-52.png)
- In Elasticbeanstalk, select the created key pair
![alt text](image-53.png)

- Click Next
- Select vpc from drop down and check the 'Public IP address' as activated
![alt text](image-54.png)
![alt text](image-55.png)
- Click Next
- In Root volume type: general purpose 3 (ssd) and then press Next
![alt text](image-56.png)
- Next -> Create
![alt text](image-57.png)

### Now lets move back to code pipeline and we will deploy the code to the elastic beanstalk
![alt text](image-58.png)
- Create Pipeline

**Deployment WILL FAIL**
Lets solve the issue:
If the Deployment fails this is because the IAM role does not have elastic beanstalk
full permission. Select code pipeline and check the role attached to itâ€¦and now go to
iam and search for the role and attach that specific role

- Click on deploy box on deploy button
![alt text](image-61.png)
- Settings -> click on service role ARN
![alt text](image-62.png)
- Add Policies
![alt text](image-63.png)
![alt text](image-64.png)
- Add Permissions
- Add retry the failed stage in pipeline
![alt text](image-65.png)
![alt text](image-66.png)
- Now lets go and check the environment endpoint url for beanstalk
